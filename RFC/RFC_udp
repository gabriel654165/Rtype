                        UDP Protocol Explanation


			FORMAT :

Protocol for each messages
Each packet are structured like this :

[Header]
  - type : is the type of packet sended/received 
  - lenthBody : is the lenght of the array (in the body in order to unpack it)
[Body]
  - list : is the body of the messages (differents for each header type)


We have 3 differents header type :
- typeHeader 0 -> MovePositions
- typeHeader 1 -> Spawn/Kill entity
- typeHeader 2 -> GameEvent



			FIELDS

The body is different for each message type sended :

Body for MovePositions :
  [0] = posX, [1] = posY, [2] = entity uuid

Body for Spawn/Kill entity :
  [0] = type of enity spawned or killed,
    - 1 : spawn a new entity by the uuid sended
    - 2 : disable a entity in the scene in order to not draw it
    - 3 : spawn a new monster (load form .so) by uuid
    - 4 : kill a entity by the uuid	sended
  [1] = the uuid of the target entity

Body for GameEvent :
  [0] = type of event
    - 1 : directions of a entity by uuid
  [1] : x movement (1 for left, 2 for right)
  [2] : y movement (1 for down, 2 for down)
  [3] = the uuid of the target entity
